this is a code that takes two byte arrays as input and the size N. it always assumes N is a power of 2. With my code is some test cases added by algorithms course prof to test if the code is functional or not
This code uses the divide and conquer algorithm. 
I will add comments later to make my code more clear
In my free time, i will try to make my code more efficient and better
